# Hello people.  
If you’re reading this, you’re probably still interested in this project — **TruthfulAC**.  

This is one of my oldest anti-cheats I ever made, started way back in **2019**, and released about two years ago. I kinda missed working on it, honestly. Now there’s a newer one, **CodeControlAC**, which is one of my best anti-cheats so far, but that one isn’t going to be fully open-source.  
This one though, **Truthful**, will always stay open-sourced.  

I’ve had a few people message me saying they’ve used the base, updated it, added their own stuff, and honestly that’s really cool to see.  
It’s become a great learning tool for people, and I seriously appreciate that.  

As for updates, this project will get them every now and then.  
I can’t promise anything consistent since I’m not getting paid to work on it, but I just don’t want to let it sit and collect dust.  
So I’m revamping a lot of things. You’ve probably already noticed from the commits that I’ve been working on it for almost a month now.  

Getting it working on modern versions after being locked on 1.8 is like talking to a brick wall.  
And it’s not doing anything because it’s a **fucking brick wall**.  

Anyway, if you want to support the project, you can **contribute**, open **pull requests**, or join the **Discord**.  
I’ll eventually put it on multiple platforms once I’m done testing everything properly.  

So yeah, stay tuned, I guess.  

**– Tawny :D**


# My Rules
1. keep updates flowing.
2. this is an old predecessor this will not be deserved to be paid this will be continued as open source.
3. will not acknowledge the trolls.
